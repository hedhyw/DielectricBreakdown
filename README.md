# DielectricBreakdown
Source codes of programs for a designed device (coursework).
The device measures parameters of dielectric films.  
The voltage on the sample is increased up to the dielectric breakdown. Voltage range is from 60 up to 380, V.

* __/Firmware/__ contains source files of firmware for an atmega48a microcontroller.
* __/SerialPortPlotter/__ contains source files of an application that visualizes the data from the microcontroller.
